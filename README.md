# TG_bot_db_3Lab
## Project on the discipline "Databases"
### Date: 24.05.2023

A project on the discipline "Databases". 
-  This application is designed to manage the work of a Telegram bot. The Aiogram library is used to create and manage the bot. 
-  SQL queries are implemented in the Python programming language. The MySQL library is used to interact with the database.

> [!NOTE]
> You must deploy the database on your system. The corresponding sql file with the database structure and test data is located in the "sql_structure_&_data" directory.
> To work correctly, you need to make changes to the files "config_bot" and "config_sql".
> - In the "config_bot" file, you must specify the Token of your previously created Telegram bot. (You can learn how to do this on the official Telegram website in the relevant documentation [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot))
> - В файле "config_sql" вы должны указать параметры подключения к вашей базе данных: host, user, password, port.
